# Trie Auto-Completion Algorithm

## Description
This Python script implements an auto-completion algorithm using a Trie data structure. The Trie data structure efficiently stores a dictionary of words and allows for fast prefix-based searches, making it suitable for auto-completion tasks.

The script consists of two main classes:
- `TrieNode`: Represents a node in the Trie data structure. Each node contains a map of children nodes and a flag indicating whether it marks the end of a word.
- `Trie`: Represents the Trie data structure itself. It contains methods for inserting words into the Trie and finding auto-completion candidates for a given query.

## Usage
To use the auto-completion algorithm:
1.  `Trie` object.
2. Dictionary by inserting words using the `insert` method.
3.  `find_candidates` method to find auto-completion candidates for a given query.
